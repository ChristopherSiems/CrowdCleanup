# CrowdCleanup

__Second place project at the Clark University Spring 2024 Hackathon!__

Crowd Cleanup is a web platform for neighbors to track and manage litter in their communities. Our goal is to make it easy and seamless for communities coordinate spontaneous cleanup efforts for their shared public spaces.
